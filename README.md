# Simple-Glimac-Setup

This is the setup to follow [these tutorials](https://igm.univ-mlv.fr/~biri/Enseignement/IMAC2/opengl-TPs/opengl.php?section=teaching&teaching=opengl&teaching_section=tds).
It has the advantage that **it is easy to use an all platforms** (Linux, Windows and Mac). 
It also fixes an annoying thing with the original setup: with this one you don't need to re-run CMake when you modify your shaders. The changes will be detected and handled automatically.

## Compiling

You need to install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/).

To use CMake I recommend this VS Code extension : [ms-vscode.cmake-tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools). 
You will need to setup the extension with a compiler. Here is [the tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/cmake-linux). It is based on Linux 
but at the bottom of the page you will find the explanations to adapt it for [Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-msvc) 
and [Mac](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-clang-mac).

Alternatively you can just create a *build* folder at the root of this project, open a terminal and run `cmake ..` ; 
chances are it will detect what compiler you have installed and generate the appropriate Makefile / Visual Studio solution / Xcode project.

## TPs

In each TP* folder, each 'ex*.cpp' file will create an executable. To create another TP folder for a new TP, just duplicate and
rename the TP folder. In each TP folder, you can also create several executable as mentionned earlier. Just rename your .cpp file 
with a name starting with the letters 'e' and 'x'

## User inputs

To learn more about the parameters you receive in the callbacks, read [glfw's documentation](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/input_guide.html).

## assets

The *assets* folder will be copied to the folder where your executable is created. You can put all the assets that your project needs in there, like textures, shaders, 3D models *etc.*
